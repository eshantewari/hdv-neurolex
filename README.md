# HDV-Neurolex VGGish Pipeline
The pipeline -- called pipeline.py in the audioset directory -- will take files from an audio input directory and output corresponding vector embeddings in JSON format to an output directory.

The following is in the .gitignore file:
A Python Virtualenv with the necessary libraries installed
The model checkpoint and the PCA parameters determined by Google's research
.pyc files

The first two can be configured correctly by following the README on the vggish repo.
